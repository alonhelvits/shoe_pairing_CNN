In this assignment, we were asked to build a convolutional neural network that can predict whether two shoes are from the same pair or from two different pairs.

My network achived the 2nd highest mean accuracy rate on the test set out of 175 Students.


My working procces in headlines:
1. Understanding the data (how it looks, originzed, labeled etc..), making sure it is labeled correctly (it wasn't).
2. Creating pairs and non-pairs of shoes and dividng the training data to train and validation
3. Writing the inital network (We recived limiation regarding the number of layers and more)
4. writing the training function, checking the model on a small subset to make sure it overfits the subset
5. Start training with different hyperparameters while watching the learning curves. Changing and improving the model to achive highest valid score
